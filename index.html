											<p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.
												Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or
												diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some
												people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people
												(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.
												Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill
												and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
												underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung
												problems, diabetes, or cancer , are at higher risk of developing serious
												illness. However anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.
												Even people with very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus.
												People of all ages who experience fever, cough and difficulty breathing
												should seek medical attention.</p>

											<p>If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be

												Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less

												to stay at home.

												However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is

												If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the

												<ul>
													<li>If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must
														self-isolate</li>
													<li> if you don’t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but
														develop symptoms, then self-isolate and monitor yourself</li>
													<li>You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the
														disease when you just have mild symptoms, therefore early
														self-isolation is very important.</li>
													<li>If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an
														infected person, self-quarantine for 14 days.</li>
												</ul>
												If you have definitely had COVID-19 (confirmed by a test) self-isolate
												for 14 days even after symptoms have disappeared as a precautionary
												measure – it is not yet known exactly how long people remain infectious
												after they have recovered. Follow national advice on self-isolation.</p>

											<p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicines

												Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are currently under

											<p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available
												on the "WHO" website and through your national and local public health
												authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19
												and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other
												countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the
												situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

												You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by
												taking some simple precautions:

												<ul>
													<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based
														hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your
														hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
														viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
													<li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
														others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray
														small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain
														virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
														including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.</li>
													<li>Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together
														in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with
														someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain
														physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).</li>
													<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many
														surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can
														transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
														virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>
													<li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
														respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
														with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
														dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why?
														Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene,
														you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu
														and COVID-19.</li>
													<li>Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as
														cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone
														bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask
														to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others
														will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</li>
													<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
														medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible
														and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why?
														National and local authorities will have the most up to date
														information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance
														will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to
														the right health facility. This will also protect you and help
														prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
													<li>Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources,
														such as "WHO" or your local and national health authorities. Why?
														Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what
														people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.</li>

											<p>Currently, there is not enough evidence for or against the use of masks
												(medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community.
												However, "WHO" is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks
												and continuously updates its guidance.<br><br>

												<em>Medical masks</em> are recommended primarily in health care
												settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below).
												Medical masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and
												control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing.<br><br>

												<em>Healthcare workers</em><br>
												<em>Why?</em> Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or
												equivalent are recommended for and should be reserved for, healthcare
												workers while giving care to patients. Close contact with people with
												suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment are
												the main routes of transmission, which means healthcare workers are the
												most exposed.<br><br>

												<em>People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19</em><br>
												<em>Why?</em> Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle
												aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and
												use a medical mask according to "WHO"’s recommendation on home care of
												patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can
												generate droplets that cause can spread the infection. These droplets
												can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding
												environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks while
												wearing a medical mask, this can help to protect those nearby from
												infection. If a sick person needs to go to a health facility they should
												wear a medical mask.<br><br>

												<em>Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19</em><br>
												<em>Why?</em> Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19
												should wear a medical mask for protection. Again, close, frequent and
												prolonged contact with someone with COVID-19 puts caretakers at high
												risk. National decision makers may also choose to recommend medical mask
												use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach
												takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and
												vulnerability of the wearer, the setting, the feasibility of use and the
												types of masks to be considered.</p>
